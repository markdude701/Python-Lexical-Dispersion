# Python-Lexical-Dispersion

## A Juypter Notebook Python file useing NLTK, requests, mathplotlib, math, os, and bs4 to collect text from a webpage, write the data into a file, and then further examined using NTLK.

## Concepts Covered:
- **Requests** - Reading text file from web page
- **NLTK** - Lexical dispersion plots, corpus, wordnet, synsets, hypernyms, sorting, lemmas, concordance, similaries, plots, tokening, frequency, frequency distributions, normalization, searching, 
- **Matplotlib** - For looping distribution subplots
- **Math** - Creating normalized ceilings
- **bs4**
- **OS** - Reading and writing
